# sc2learn

Goal of this project is to use pysc2(https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) interface
to Starcraft II(https://www.starcraft2.com) and investigate and compare the following possible bots:

+ Scripted bots - Rule based bots with some random build orders and attack strategies.
+ Supervised bots - Bots that learn how to play SC2 from replays of humans playing the game.
+ RL bots - Bots that use reinforcement learning to learn from mistakes and improve.
+ SSRL bots - Scripted + Supervised + RL bots, combination of all 3 styles.
